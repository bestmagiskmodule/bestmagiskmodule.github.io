### **3. Consider Refinancing**

**Refinancing** involves taking out a new loan to pay off an existing one, potentially at a lower interest rate or with better terms.

### **4. Plan for Early Repayment**

Paying off your loan early can save on interest costs, but be aware of any prepayment penalties that might apply.

#### **Early Repayment Tips**

- **Check Penalties:** Verify if there are any penalties for early repayment.
- **Extra Payments:** Make additional payments towards the principal.
