In this guide, we&#39;ll explore the various facets of being an attorney, including their roles, responsibilities, and how they can impact your legal journey. Let&#39;s dive in!</p>
<p></p>
<h2>**What is an Attorney?**</h2>
<p></p>
<p>An attorney, often referred to as a lawyer, is a professional who provides legal advice and representation to clients. Their primary role is to help individuals and organizations understand their legal rights and obligations, and to advocate on their behalf in legal matters.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>**Key Responsibilities of an Attorney**</h3>
<p></p>
<p>1. <strong>Legal Representation</strong></p>

<p></p>
